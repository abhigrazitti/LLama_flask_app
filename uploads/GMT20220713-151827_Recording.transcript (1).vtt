69
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.600
Vishal Bhardwaj: I think.

70
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.850
Vishal Bhardwaj: Also, the next trip on next ticket is about the update for skirt comes.

71
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:37.380
Vishal Bhardwaj: assume they might have been some confusion regarding the zip codes, so the file that we have uploaded already had the zip code in the in the file, and for that i've also opened our account, and you can see the zip code look up is all also updated.

72
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.360
Vishal Bhardwaj: As for the support.

73
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.900
Vishal Bhardwaj: In the file.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.950
Dhana Luna: Can you go back to the.

75
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.460
Dhana Luna: comment from sun about.

76
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.740
I said this was this was.

77
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.520
Dhana Luna: Okay.

78
00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:03.090
Dhana Luna: All right, that's what I was going to offer so leaving that aside, there is another.

79
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:16.500
Dhana Luna: Come on, let me get this slide from Helen, so there is another believe, unfortunately, if not dived into.

80
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:25.800
Dhana Luna: Some of these tickets, but seven identify basically that popularity spore and customer segments.

81
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.430
um.

82
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.790
Dhana Luna: it's now possible okay.

83
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.830
Vishal Bhardwaj: And so.

84
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.330
Please.

85
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:45.540
Vishal Bhardwaj: Okay, so about the strategic manner, I mean customer segment and the Foster popularity school these two fields so we're also I mean.

86
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.980
Vishal Bhardwaj: I have to confirm about the popularity school, but the customer segment.

87
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.580
Vishal Bhardwaj: was not really there on this ticket, I mean on the files that were shared initially.

88
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.150
Vishal Bhardwaj: So.

89
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.150
Dhana Luna: But this is not the flower going on.

90
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:13.560
Vishal Bhardwaj: You can see the customer segment was not there, so that is why it was not uploaded initially, however, it was given in I mean in the.

91
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:22.260
Vishal Bhardwaj: Later phase of this update, so our own card was the one who was going to pick this as a silence.

92
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.630
Vishal Bhardwaj: reply.

93
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.510
Vishal Bhardwaj: I mean command, so let me just open the command as well.

94
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:37.890
Dhana Luna: So there must be a confusion, because there's a file that we've been updating, which is the one that we should be leveraging for the updates so there's a comment from me.

95
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:39.810
Dhana Luna: know.

96
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:54.540
Vishal Bhardwaj: Let me just open the come in, so this was the coming from Hong Kong, so he was going to pick the strategic management and the fsu popularity school.

97
00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:08.010
Dhana Luna: which he did, but he is doing that, based off of the file that I provided and I updated so if you find my there's a comment on there, where I think the file, that we should be using for update.

98
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.640
I believe.

99
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.770
Dhana Luna: I think it's below.

100
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.420
Dhana Luna: That one.

101
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.940
Dhana Luna: This one yeah.

102
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.930
Vishal Bhardwaj: So I guess this one was regarding the updating the owners of the account.

103
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.440
Dhana Luna: girl, and the file should wow.

104
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:06.180
Vishal Bhardwaj: This one does have the customer segment and foursquare popularity the witches ultimately the foursquare populating scope on salesforce.

105
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:23.610
Vishal Bhardwaj: Okay, so do you want us to update this, so we can take this in the morning and maybe by tomorrow if now having your morning tomorrow, you can get the state.

106
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.970
Dhana Luna: That works for me thank you.

107
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.110
Vishal Bhardwaj: Okay, so we'll pick this up and update the accounts.

108
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.310
perfect.

109
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.960
Vishal Bhardwaj: So do we also need to update the account owners as well.

110
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:44.730
Dhana Luna: I believe, because there was a little bit of urgency around that if someone already took care of that.

111
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:54.660
Vishal Bhardwaj: Okay, so we'll check for that, if the account owners are not updated it so we'll take that up as go ahead.

112
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.970
Dhana Luna: All right, Okay, thank you.

113
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:12.900
Vishal Bhardwaj: So I think that is all about this ticket and about the onboarding record enhancement, this is still in today so i'll go to this ticket, as I was working on another ticket, so I didn't get time for this.

114
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:15.870
Dhana Luna: that's fine.

115
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:20.670
Vishal Bhardwaj: Just open this.

116
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:31.050
Vishal Bhardwaj: So this is the ongoing enhancements card, so I love work on this ticket and we'll get back to you with the initial questions that I have.

117
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.070
Dhana Luna: I think I think it sounds like.

118
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.430
Dhana Luna: A plan.

119
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:37.110
Okay.

120
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.080
Dhana Luna: Sorry for the background noise.

121
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.660
Vishal Bhardwaj: I think it's fine it's not that much.

122
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.350
Vishal Bhardwaj: So the next ticket is about the asset collection from bugs so.
